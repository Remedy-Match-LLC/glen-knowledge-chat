# baseline in tests/known_failures.txt, failing only on a NEW failure. It replaced an
# --ignore list of 242 whole FILES (ci/excluded-tests.txt, now deleted): excluding a file
# threw away every passing test in it just to silence one failure, whereas the baseline
# accepts individual TESTS. ~6400 gated tests instead of ~3700, and the ratchet reports
# tests that now pass so the baseline only tightens.
