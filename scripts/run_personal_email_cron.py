"""Daily Personal email cron entry point.

Runs on Render's cron worker. Posts to the web service's
/cron/personal-send endpoint, which executes the orchestrator inside
the web container (where the persistent disk and chat_log.db live).

Render cron containers do NOT share the web service's persistent disk.
Calling the orchestrator directly here would crash on
sqlite3.connect("/data/chat_log.db") because /data is not mounted in
the cron container.

Required env vars on the cron service:
  WEB_URL       — base URL of the web service (no trailing slash)
                  default: https://glen-knowledge-chat.onrender.com
  CRON_SECRET   — shared secret matching the web service's CRON_SECRET
                  (or CONSOLE_SECRET fallback). Sent as X-Cron-Secret.
