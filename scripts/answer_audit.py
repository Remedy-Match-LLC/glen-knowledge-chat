"""Ask the LIVE bot real buying questions and check its facts against the catalog.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The unit suite checks structure — that a link table has rows, that a prompt has
a rule. It cannot check TRUTH. Two customer-facing money bugs shipped on
2026-07-20 and neither was findable by any test:

  * the NIR Brain Frequency Helmet ($4,997 + $32 shipping) was quoted live as
    "$754 (includes $132 shipping)" — the $132 had leaked from another product
  * "Harmony Soft Laser" was linked to /begin/product/clarity, a $69.97
    formulation rather than the $997 laser

Both were single clauses inside fluent, confident answers. Both were found by a
human reading a complete response. This automates that reading.

WHAT IT CHECKS

For each question, against the answer the live bot actually returns:

  1. LINK TARGETS EXIST      — every /begin/product/<slug> resolves in the catalog
  2. LINK TEXT MATCHES       — the anchor text names the product it links to
                               (catches clarity-linked-as-Harmony)
  3. PRICES ARE REAL         — every dollar figure equals a price or shipping
                               figure of a product named in that answer
  4. NO RETIRED DESTINATIONS — no practicebetter.io, no GrooveKart storefront
  5. NO INVENTED MECHANISM   — for the "claim" questions only, none of the
                               phrases the bot invented about AngioGenX on
                               2026-10-08 (how it works, why a caution exists)

The claim check is a canary for known invented phrases, not proof of source
fidelity: a clean claim answer can still say something no source supports, and
a flagged phrase may turn out to be sourced.

Findings are reported, never auto-fixed: a false positive here is cheap, a
wrong "all clear" is not.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/answer_audit.py                     # production
    python3 scripts/answer_audit.py --base http://localhost:5000
    python3 scripts/answer_audit.py --only price        # one question set

Exits non-zero if anything is flagged, so it can be scheduled.
