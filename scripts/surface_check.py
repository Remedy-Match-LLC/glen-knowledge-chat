"""Public-surface drift detector — piggybacked on the one always-on Render cron.

Why this exists: `FIRESIDE_ENABLED` is not declared in render.yaml, so nothing
pins it on. It silently drifted OFF and /begin/fireside 404'd in production while
/begin still shipped a live "Sit by the fire" CTA pointing straight at it. Nothing
alerted; the only symptom was visitors landing on a dead page.

So this checks the SYMPTOM a visitor experiences (an HTTP status on the real URL)
rather than the config we happen to suspect today. That also catches a deleted
route, a missing template, a bad deploy, or the app being down.

It runs in the CRON container, which is a separate service from the web app. That
matters: a checker living inside the web app cannot alert when the web app is the
thing that's broken.

Failure rule: `status >= 400`, or the request raised. A 3xx redirect is NOT a
failure — /prepay and /begin/choose legitimately 302, and a redirect is not a
dead page.

No database. No throttle table: the host cron runs daily, so the schedule IS the
throttle — at most one alert per day while a surface is down.

Stdlib only (the cron's buildCommand is `true`).
