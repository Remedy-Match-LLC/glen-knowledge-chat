"""Read-only 3-phase onboarding status for the portal tile. Pure computation
from existing per-email stores; NO writes, NO new tables. Token-agnostic hrefs
(anchors) are prefixed with /portal/<token> by the route (Task 2).

NOTE on recommendation_events.product_sources: the brief's sketch assumed a
{product_key: {source_key: {...}}} shape. The real implementation returns a
LIST of per-product dicts: [{"product_key":..., "hidden":..., "sources":
[{"source": sk, "count":..., "first_touch":..., "last_touch":...}, ...]}, ...].
_has_source below is written against the real (list) shape.
