"""Intelligence briefing runner.

Gathers live system stats from the existing dashboard modules, asks Claude to
compose each of the five briefings (daily-briefing, eyes-on-every-street,
founders-radar, revenue-x-ray, pattern-which-connects), and persists each
briefing to the intelligence_briefings DB table (via dashboard.intelligence)
so the dashboard cards serve fresh content.

Triggered by POST /cron/regenerate-briefings (which is curled by the Render
cron container). Lives in the web container so it has access to the persistent
disk, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, and all the same internal stat functions the
dashboard already uses.
