"""Role-aware portal view assembler.

`get_portal_view(cx, person_id)` composes ONE payload from the unified person
row plus orders, points, and the existing biofield portal content. The page and
APIs render whichever blocks come back; visibility is driven by roles, and any
absent/unavailable data hides its block rather than erroring.

Self-contained (takes a `cx`, never imports `app`) so it unit-tests in isolation.
Order/points/biofield reads are defensive: a failure degrades to an empty block.
