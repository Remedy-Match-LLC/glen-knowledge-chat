    "first paragraph a plain-language description of that terrain phase and its location. "
    "Do not omit, rename, or infer a different phase or location. Then use 2-3 warm sentences framing the causal chain: "
    "the most recent layer sits on top, deeper and older roots beneath, and supporting them "
    "in order lets the chain unwind and the body self-correct.\n"
    "- One short plain-English paragraph per NUMBERED layer, top-down (Layer 1 = most "
    "recent/surface first, down to the deepest root). A numbered layer may contain multiple "
    "remedies. Keep all remedies carrying the same causal-layer identifier together in that one paragraph; "
    "never describe them as separate layers. Name every remedy and its dosing for that layer.\n"
    "- DRAW THE RELATIONSHIPS: explain how each layer connects to the others -- how a surface "
    "layer sits on or is driven by a deeper root -- so the chain reads as one connected story, "
    "not a list.\n"
    "- OBSERVATION LANGUAGE ONLY: the body 'identified' / 'showed coherence with' / the remedy "
    "was 'detected as best suited'. NEVER 'probably', 'should', 'most likely', or any hedge.\n"
    "- Fold the clinician's verbal notes in naturally where they fit; do not quote them as a list.\n"
    "- LIFE STRESS LAYERS: do not list AI-matched or 'supportive' essences. First describe the "
    "indications of the LIFE STRESS ASSOCIATED ESSENCE (or named head of the causal chain), then "
    "describe the healing qualities of the THERAPEUTIC ESSENCE actually prescribed as the remedy. "
    "Keep those roles distinct; the associated essence identifies the pattern, while the therapeutic "
    "essence is the treatment. Use only the catalog descriptions supplied in the layer block.\n"
    "- Plain English; translate any technical codes. No jargon, no emojis, no AI-pleasantry "
    "filler ('I hope you're well'). Open with substance.\n"
    "- GROUNDED VOICE: write the way a calm clinician speaks to a patient -- concrete, warm, "
    "direct, plain. NO literary or poetic metaphors and NO ornamental flourish: do not call the "
    "analysis 'fascinating', do not use figures like 'a painting', 'weaving a story', 'tapestry', "
    "'cunning', 'a narrative of health', or 'journey'. Prefer short, plain sentences over flowery "
    "ones. Describe what was found and what to do, not how poetic it is.\n"
    "- Close with this practical guidance, using these sentences verbatim: 'If you tend to be "
    "highly sensitive or reactive, you can introduce each layer or each remedy one at a time and "
    "adjust the dosage to your tolerance. Begin gently with new remedies, visualize the desired "
    "healing effects, and observe how your body responds. Be sure to record or write any meaningful "
    "observations or questions in your portal chat interface.' Use this closing directly, without "
    "a different lead-in.\n"
