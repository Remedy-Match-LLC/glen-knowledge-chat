# button — the same row feeds display, entitlement (_biofield_visible_slugs),
# live pricing, and checkout, so substituting once here keeps all four in sync
# (swapping only the display would post a slug checkout then rejects).

# (syntropy 249-stress-release, /begin/buy/stress-release resolves). Glen 2026-07-14.
#
# The map ALSO carries preference substitutions — a remedy Glen no longer wants
# recommended in a reveal, swapped for the product he wants recommended in its
# place (both sellable). "AllerFree" -> "Immune Modulation" and "Bone Builder"
# -> "Neuro-Magnesium" (immune-modulation and neuro-magnesium both resolve at
# /begin/buy/ at $69.97). Reveal-scoped by design (per Glen 2026-07-19): the
# chatbot FF matcher is untouched. Same mechanism as Relax — swap once on the
# shared row so display, entitlement, pricing, and checkout stay in sync.
