"""Owned-consumables projection for the "My Healing Oasis" client-portal tile.

`replenish_items(cx, email)` walks a client's order history and projects it
down to the CONSUMABLE products they have ever ordered -- one row per slug
with the most recent order date, how many times it was ordered, and a
lightweight `running_low` hint (days since last order >= `_TYPICAL_BOTTLE_DAYS`).
Devices/tools/books/services/info-only lines are excluded via `_is_consumable`.

Pure-ish: the only I/O is the `cx` read the caller supplies (LOG_DB in prod);
`catalog` and `today` are injectable so this unit-tests without app.py or a
real clock. Never raises on a malformed order row, a malformed line item, or a
malformed (non-dict) catalog entry -- each degrades by skipping just that
item rather than crashing the portal tile (see `_fetch_orders_raw` for why
the order read does not call `dashboard.orders.list_orders_by_email`
directly)."""
