"""A scan's own recommendations, mirrored from the local e4l.db into prod.

Production cannot read e4l.db, so `02 Skills/e4l-scan-recommendations-push.py` POSTs
these rows to a console-gated endpoint. Pure sqlite: no Flask, no network.

`section` is carried verbatim from e4l_scan_results.section_context — the scan PDF's
own "INFOCEUTICALS" / "MIHEALTH FUNCTIONS" headings. It is NOT re-derived from
protocol_days, which only correlates. "The five infoceuticals" is therefore a query.

Keyed on (email, scan_id, priority_rank) — rank is unique per scan in the source
data, but item_code is NOT: a two-column PDF layout can flatten to the same
item_code printed twice at two different ranks in one scan (e.g. scan 542814's
ER1/ER10/ER36 each appear at two ranks), and both rows are real and must both be
stored. A scan's rows are therefore replaced atomically via `replace_scan` — delete
this (email, scan_id)'s rows and insert the full incoming set in one transaction —
rather than upserted per item, which would let the second of a duplicated pair
silently overwrite the first.

An empty or all-invalid item list must never delete a client's stored
recommendations — that hazard (an empty extraction wiping real data) was found and
fixed in the sibling local script; `replace_scan` returns 0 and touches nothing
when there is nothing valid to write.
