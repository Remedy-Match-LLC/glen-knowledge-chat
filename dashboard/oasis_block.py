"""dashboard/oasis_block.py — the "My Healing Oasis" client-portal tile payload.

Composes the three sibling modules into one block:
  - replenish       -> oasis_replenish.replenish_items: owned CONSUMABLES from
                       the client's order history (restock hints).
  - build_out.owned_from_us    -> DEVICE/TOOL products ordered from us (an
                       explicit device allowlist, oasis_replenish.is_device --
                       NOT simply the non-consumables, since that complement
                       also includes services/consults, info_only, digital
                       ebooks, and print books, none of which are "tools you
                       own").
  - build_out.owned_external   -> owned_tools.list_for: tools the client has
                       self-reported, whether or not they map to a catalog slug.
  - build_out.roadmap -> oasis_roadmap.build_roadmap: the personalized gap list,
                       built from the union of device slugs (ours + external),
                       normalized onto the roadmap's simplified hero-family
                       slugs (see _normalize_owned_for_roadmap below).
  - build_out.wanted  -> _wanted_items: the client's wishlist (shared with My
                       Remedies' "Add to my Oasis" and this tile's own
                       "Add to wishlist" roadmap action), resolved to
                       {slug, name, url} so the client can see what they've
                       flagged, not just an ephemeral "Added" toast.

Returns {"enabled": False} outright when the flag is off. Each sub-field is
independently try/except guarded so one failing source degrades to an empty
list rather than breaking the whole block -- or the rest of the portal
payload, which composes many other unrelated blocks alongside this one."""
