"""Family Plan store + entitlement. Pure sqlite, no Flask, no Stripe.

One plan per CAREGIVER. It is the single entitlement source for the whole
consented household — full scan results, member product pricing, the monthly
family shipment, and group coaching access all ask the same `covers()`.

Mirrors dashboard/coach_subscriptions.py: this module holds state only;
money-path correctness (idempotent first charge, no cron double-charge) lives in
the routes/cron, guarded by next_charge_at advancing only on success.

`past_due` still covers: a failed renewal must not blur a client's report
mid-month. The cron cancels after its retry budget, and cancelling stops cover.
