"""Increment 4a: native authoring store for the local Biofield Analysis tool.

Lets Glen author a biofield test in the app instead of FileMaker. A test is a
header + causal-chain rows entered directly (streamlined vs FMP's stress->promote
flow). `authored_report` returns the SAME shape as `biofield_report.causal_chain_report`
so the schedule, narrative, and your-voice audio all work on authored tests unchanged.

Authored test ids are prefixed "a" (e.g. "a7") so the viewer can tell them apart
from the numeric FMP-snapshot ids. Local + writable; PHI stays on the Mac.
