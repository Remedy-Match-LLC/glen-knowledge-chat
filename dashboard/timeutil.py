"""One way to read a timestamp column.

`auth_tokens.expires_at` (and friends) were written by several different
minters over time, and they do not agree on a format. All three of these are
live in the production table right now:

    2026-07-09T17:49:00.002684+00:00     offset-aware
    2026-08-08T17:33:59.998605Z          Z-suffixed, naive
    2027-07-09T17:33:59.999677           bare naive

Each validator used to parse the way its own minter happened to write, so the
pairs were self-consistent by luck. Any code that read a column generically hit

    TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

and several validators swallowed that in a bare `except`, which quietly reports
a perfectly good token as EXPIRED. `parse_utc` accepts all three shapes and
always returns an aware UTC datetime, so a comparison can never raise.

Naive values are treated as UTC, which is correct: every minter that writes
them uses `datetime.utcnow()`.
