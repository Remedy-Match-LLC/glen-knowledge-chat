"""Public, unauthenticated surfaces: the sample portal and the practitioner storefront.

Design rule (see spec 2026-07-19-public-surfaces-storefront-and-demo.md §2):
public payloads are built from an explicit field WHITELIST, never by filtering a
private payload down. Filters fail open — the day someone adds a field to the
portal payload, a filter-based public view silently publishes it. A whitelist
fails closed.

`build_demo_view()` deliberately takes no `cx`. That is the enforcement
mechanism, not a convention: there is no code path from this function to real
client data, so no flag can be misconfigured into leaking one.

Sample content is clinically neutral on purpose. A compelling fictional outcome
functions as an implied health claim.
