"""Single per-kind settlement definition for a PAID checkout order, called by
BOTH the /begin/checkout-return redirect and the Stripe webhook book-back, so a
closed browser tab settles exactly what the redirect settles (no drift).

This module owns ONLY the dispatch. The actual side-effect functions live in
app.py (they need LOG_DB, Stripe, etc.) and are injected as `deps` -- mirroring
how qbo_heal takes find_receipt/book/stamp. It deliberately does NOT touch
mark-paid / receipt-booking / PI-stamp; those already fire correctly in each
caller. Every dep is idempotent per order_ref, so calling from both paths and
re-running is safe.
