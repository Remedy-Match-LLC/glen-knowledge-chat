"""Stripe payments ledger — a money-first read over the orders table.

The console has order boards but no transaction ledger. This model exposes the
subset of orders that captured card money via Stripe, plus the recent
`stripe_failures` (declined/failed charges) so failed subscription renewals can't
go unseen. Read-only: nothing here moves money or mutates orders.

A "payment" is an order where ANY of:
  - `stripe_payment_intent` is set (one-time checkout: retail funnel / in-house
    card — set via orders.set_order_stripe_pi), OR
  - `external_ref` is a Stripe PaymentIntent id (`pi_...`) — every recurring charge
    (subscription renewals AND the $99/mo coaching `membership` charge) is ingested
    only when the PaymentIntent SUCCEEDS, storing the PI id in `external_ref`, NOT
    the column, OR
  - `source` is a known recurring-charge source — belt-and-suspenders for the rare
    case where the QBO invoice id was stored instead of the PI id.
A $0 `founding` card-vault reservation (external_ref is a `seti_` SetupIntent) is
NOT a captured charge and is excluded. Caller sets cx.row_factory = sqlite3.Row.
