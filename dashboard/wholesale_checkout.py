"""Practitioner wholesale checkout — the money path (Phase 3e).

``build_order`` (product cart) is QBO paid-only (Stage 4): it prices the cart and
resolves the Wellness Credit redemption up front against a freshly-minted
``checkout_ref`` token -- NOT a QBO invoice id, since no invoice is created at
checkout time. A real, line-faithful QBO Sales Receipt is booked later by the
return-handler (once payment is confirmed) from the ``qbo_payload`` this returns.
Redemption happens before booking (a Sales Receipt is final once posted) and is
idempotent on ``checkout_ref``.

``quote_module`` (certification tuition) is the paid-only module path: it
previews what a coach owes WITHOUT creating a QBO invoice or redeeming credit
at signup -- credit is redeemed only when the payment is recorded (a Sales
Receipt), matching the no-A/R-at-signup policy.
