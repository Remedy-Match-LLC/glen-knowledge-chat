"""Product content layer for the RemedyMatch funnel.

Source of truth for ingredients + page copy is Pinecone `specific-formulations`
(index remedy-match-llc) — each product is stored as chunks whose metadata.text
holds the remedymatch.com page (Contents/ingredients panel + benefit copy). We
fetch ALL chunks for a product by an EXACT title filter (deterministic — no fuzzy
embedding match, which mis-maps infoceuticals), order by chunk_index, and concat.

(The structured FMP ingredient tables live in a separate Supabase project that is
currently paused, so it is not a reliable runtime dependency. Pinecone carries the
same product copy and is always available.)

Two generated, cached content types per product:
  - 'card'       -> {description, ingredients[], benefits[]}  (the product page)
  - 'learn_more' -> {markdown, sources[]}                     (the research page)

Generation is grounded ONLY in retrieved text (page copy + per-ingredient research
studies from the `ingredients` namespace, which carry real study URLs), so the
model extracts/cites rather than invents. Results are cached in chat_log.db keyed
by (product_slug, content_type); regenerate via the console-gated refresh endpoint.
