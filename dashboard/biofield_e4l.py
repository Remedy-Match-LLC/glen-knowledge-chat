E4L scans live in a SEPARATE database, ~/AI-Training/e4l.db (kept fresh by the

as the client is identified, `scan_context()` reads that DB read-only and reports:
freshness (within a 2-week window), how many days ago the scan was, and the scan's
ranked findings. It NEVER raises — a missing DB, blank email, unknown client, or no
scan all return status "none" so the intake flow is never blocked.

The query (latest-scan + identity-merge handling + ranked findings) is vendored from
the vault tool `02 Skills/e4l_synthesis.py`, which is not importable by this app.
