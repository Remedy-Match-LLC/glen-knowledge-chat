"""Member identity glue for MentorshipU LMS.

Resolves a course-scoped access token (`dashboard.course_tokens`) to a member
level. Distinct from the client portal token — a course link grants course
access only, never portal/PII access. Kept pure of `app` (never imports it)
so it unit-tests fast and in isolation.
