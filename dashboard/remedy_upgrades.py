"""Conservative external-product -> our-equivalent mapping for the "My Remedies"
client-portal tile. The external-stack section lists, per product a client takes
from other companies, an optional pointer to our equivalent formulation — but
only where one genuinely helps clinically. This is NOT a blanket upsell: a
well-chosen external product (including one that already equals our own slug)
is left alone and `suggest_upgrade` returns None.

Matching is via a curated `_UPGRADE_MAP` keyed on a normalized ingredient/category
derived from the product NAME (re-using the `_key`-style normalization pattern
from `dashboard.supplement_reviews`) — NOT a fuzzy name match against arbitrary
brand products. An unmapped product (or a mapped one whose slug is missing from
the resolved catalog) returns None so we never point at a dead product."""
