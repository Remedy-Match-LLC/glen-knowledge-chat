"""Shipping — USPS Flat Rate auto-update + box-fit matrix for manual orders.

Three tables on the existing chat_log.db (persistent /data disk on Render):

  bottle_types   — Glen/Rae catalog of SKU shapes (e.g., "dropper 1oz")
  box_capacity   — per (bottle_type, box_size) → max qty that fits
  usps_rates     — historical USPS retail prices + Glen's charged price after
                   the rounding rule (≥50¢ up, ≤49¢ down). Each rate row
                   carries `confirmed_by` so we can stage proposed updates
                   from the watcher and require Glen's manual approval before
                   they go live (matches the "money changes are human-triggered"
                   rule).

Public surface used by app.py routes + the order-entry page:

  init_shipping_schema(cx)      — idempotent migration
  round_to_dollar(cents)        — Glen's rounding rule
  pick_box({bottle_name: qty})  — smallest S/M/L box that fits the order
  quote({bottle_name: qty})     — pick_box + current charged shipping cost
  get_current_rates()           — latest confirmed rate per box size
  list_bottle_types() / add_bottle_type() / delete_bottle_type()
  get_capacity_matrix() / set_box_capacity()
  propose_rate_update() / list_pending_rate_updates() / confirm_rate_update()
