"""Household / caregiver→member links + within-household scan reassignment.

A caregiver (primary_email) links to member scan accounts (member_email). The
primary may VIEW any linked member's portal; the owner may REASSIGN a mis-attributed
portal report among the members of one household. Lives in LOG_DB (SQLite). Every
scan-subject already has its own E4L email, so members are ordinary email accounts."""
