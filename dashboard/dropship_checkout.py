"""Practitioner-paid drop-ship: price each line at the drop-ship wholesale
(blended base + 33% of the RETAIL markup), ship to the patient. The
practitioner bills the patient privately (margin off-platform).

``build_dropship_order`` is QBO paid-only (Stage 4): it prices the cart and
resolves the Wellness Credit redemption up front against a freshly-minted
``checkout_ref`` token -- NOT a QBO invoice id, since no invoice is created at
checkout time. A real, line-faithful QBO Sales Receipt is booked later by the
return-handler (once payment is confirmed) from the ``qbo_payload`` this returns.
Redemption happens before booking (a Sales Receipt is final once posted) and is
idempotent on ``checkout_ref``.

Also provides build_client_order — the patient-paid sibling where the patient is
invoiced at the practitioner's price S and the practitioner's margin (S - base - fee)
is returned for wallet crediting on payment. (Unchanged/out of scope here.)"""

    The patient is the QBO customer and pays S per bottle.  The practitioner's
    margin (S − base − fee) is summed and returned so the caller can credit it
    to the practitioner's wallet once payment clears.

    When ``effective_settings`` is provided the patient RECEIVES the
    practitioner's best-of volume discount off S (same engine helpers the direct
    channel uses): the discount comes OUT of the practitioner's margin, clamped
    to the house ceilings baked into ``effective_settings`` and floored via
    ``pricing.unit_floor_cents``.  When ``effective_settings`` is None the
    behavior is byte-identical to the flat-S baseline (no discount, unchanged
    margin) — the discount machinery is skipped entirely.

    ``build_client_order`` is QBO paid-only (Stage 4): no QBO invoice/customer
    is created at checkout time -- a fresh ``checkout_ref`` token is minted and
    a line-faithful ``qbo_payload`` is returned for the route to persist. The
    return-handler (already wired for kind="client") books a real QBO Sales
    Receipt from it once payment is confirmed. The points-redeem/ship-credit
    discount is already resolved before this point (never a QBO invoice id),
    so this is a straight Pattern-I conversion.

    Key differences from build_dropship_order:
    - QBO customer = the PATIENT (patient["email"]) -- but not created here;
      the return-handler resolves it when booking the Sales Receipt.
    - Each line is priced at S = practitioner_price_for(pid, slug) (>= MAP),
      optionally reduced by the practitioner-effective volume discount.
    - base/fee/margin computed via quote_line(selling_cents=S, qty=total_bottles).
    - Ship to patient["ship"]; source = "dispensary".
    - GET recorded-not-charged on the patient's ship-to state.
    - NO wallet redeem (the margin is credited on PAID, not here).

    Returns dict with ok / invoice_id (checkout_ref token) / total / customer_id
