"""A retired duplicate must still map to the storefront, via its live twin.

`aces-eyedrops` and `aces-eye-drops` are the same FMP product (fmp_id 158) under two
slugs. Retiring one with `inactive: true` made `_get_product` return None, which killed
its product page, its checkout, and any old link or order-history slug pointing at it —
even though a perfectly good surviving record exists.

`_superseded()` already knows how to follow the pointer, but only remedy-name resolution
used it (`_live_slug`); the storefront never did. Now `_get_product` follows it, so every
consumer redirects transparently. A record that is inactive with NO successor still
resolves to None — retired means retired.
