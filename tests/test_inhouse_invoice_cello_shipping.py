#
# Regression test for the console order path: `_price_inhouse_invoice` built the
# cart it hands to `_price_cart` WITHOUT the line `format`, so cello (`refill`)
# lines were priced/packed as rigid bottles on the console order-entry / invoice-
# edit path -- the exact over-charge the cello-pack feature exists to fix. Counts
# and display already showed cello correctly (they read the stored `format`), so
# before the fix "counts say cello, rate says bottle." This test proves the fix
# THROUGH `_price_inhouse_invoice` (the path that was broken), not through
# `_price_cart` directly (already covered by test_price_cart_cello_shipping.py).
