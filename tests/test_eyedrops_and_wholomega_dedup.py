"""Remaining catalog gaps after #746.

1. Four ACTIVE eye-drop records still had no `bottle_type`. An unmapped product resolves
   to the "default" placeholder, which quote() cannot pack, so the WHOLE cart it rides in
   silently falls back to the coarse qty rule. Glen: map them to 5ml, like every other
   mapped eye drop.

2. `wholomega` and `wholomega-30-gelcaps` are the same product at the same $69.97 under
   two slugs. Glen: `wholomega` is canonical. Retire the twin with `superseded_by` so the
   storefront, order history and FMP-id lookups all redirect to the survivor (#746 made
   `_get_product` follow that pointer).
