"""The set of flags that must be on lives in a committed file, not a hardcoded tuple.

PR #759 watched four flags. The root-cause dig that evening found EIGHT had been deleted
from the prod service — five still off, silently disabling a Stripe monthly checkout, the
two-door reveal, the prepay ladder, analysis-quota enforcement and the review flow. The
#759 watchdog would not have caught one of them.

Render sells no audit log on this plan (`audit logs not available for this plan`), and its
events API never records env changes. So attribution has to come from somewhere else:
with a committed baseline, turning a flag off is a PULL REQUEST. Git records who intended
it. That is the point; the alerting is secondary.
