"""One bottle vocabulary, and it is prod's.

Prod's `bottle_types` library was hand-built through /admin/shipping with names like
'30 Caps' and 'Dropper 5 mL'. The repo used its own private names ('30cap', '5ml') and
`_STANDARD_BOTTLES` only seeds a FRESH catalog, so prod never received them. Result: a
`bottle_type` written into products.json was INERT in prod — `pick_boxes` raised
UnknownBottleType on the unknown name, `quote()` returned no rate, and the whole cart
silently fell back to the coarse qty rule. Green tests, zero production effect, because
the test fixture seeded the repo's own vocabulary.

So: the repo now speaks prod's names. Verified against the live library 2026-07-09.
