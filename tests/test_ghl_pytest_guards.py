"""The GHL write paths must be inert under pytest.

Both of these reach out to Glen's LIVE CRM: dashboard.ghl_email.send_via_ghl upserts a real
contact and then sends a real email, and app.ghl_upsert_contact creates/mutates a real
contact (five callers). Until these guards existed they were safe only by accident -- GHL
credentials happen to be absent from the dev config, so both short-circuited on their
"not configured" branch. Adding creds there would have made a full-suite run write to the
CRM and email real people.

So each test below supplies fake credentials, which is the ONLY state in which the guard is
load-bearing, and asserts no HTTP call is made. Without the guard these fail (they attempt a
live request); with it they pass.
