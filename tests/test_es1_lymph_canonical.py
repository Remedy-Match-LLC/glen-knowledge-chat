"""ES1 is Lymph, not Immune — and fixing that needs the matcher, not just the catalog.

`resolve_remedy_name` fuzzy-matches spoken remedy names against **FMP's** product
names. FMP has exactly one ES1 row and it is misnamed "Immune". So saying the true
name auto-corrected to the false one, which is how "ES1 Immune Energetic Star
Infoceutical" reached a client's published report while its reorder line pointed at
the OTHER twin's slug (`es1-lymph`, the record with the real storefront URL).

Retiring the misnamed twin alone makes it WORSE: it strips the only ES1 from the
candidate pool, and the matcher reaches for a neighbour —

    "ES1 Immune Energetic Star Infoceutical" -> ES5 Auto-Immune ...
    "ES1 Lymph  Energetic Star Infoceutical" -> ES8 Chill ...

Different remedies, silently, on a causal chain. Three changes, tested here:

  1. the candidate pool also carries ACTIVE CATALOG names, so a survivor that lives
     only in the catalog (no `fmp_id`) is matchable at all;
  2. an exact spoken match on a RETIRED name redirects to its survivor's canonical
     name rather than fuzzy-matching onto a stranger;
  3. `es1-lymph` becomes the canonical, long-form ES1 record.
