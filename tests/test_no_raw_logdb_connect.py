"""Guard: no raw sqlite3 connect to the chat-log DB may bypass the db adapter.

A raw ``sqlite3.connect(...)`` (any alias, any argument form -- LOG_DB, a helper
like ``_db_path()`` / ``_default_db_path()`` / ``_log_db()``, or a ``chat_log.db``
literal) always opens the local SQLite file. So on ``DB_BACKEND=postgres`` such a
call silently reads stale data and loses writes instead of routing to Postgres.
Every chat-log connection MUST go through ``db.connect(...)``.

This is default-deny: ANY raw sqlite3 connect in the scanned production modules is
a violation, UNLESS the file is a genuinely-other database (e4l / FileMaker
snapshot / a ``__main__`` CLI tool that never runs under the Postgres adapter),
enumerated in ``_ALLOWED`` with the reason. Add to ``_ALLOWED`` only for a real
non-chat_log database. See the P06 cutover repoint.
