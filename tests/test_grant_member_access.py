"""One-click "grant 30-day member access + reprice" on the invoice editor.

A paid $300 Causal Biofield Analysis auto-grants a 30-day care_taster membership
(_fulfill_biofield_program) that flips on member pricing. Clients invoiced by hand
never hit that path, so their FF capsules stay at full price. POST
/api/orders/<oid>/grant-member-access closes the gap in one click: grant the same
care_taster window, then reprice the order's own lines at the now-active member rate.

Rules under test:
  * The grant is a care_taster membership for the order's email.
  * Member pricing is active BY the time the reprice runs (grant committed first).
  * Override lines are re-sent WITH unit_cents (preserved); auto-priced lines are
    re-sent WITHOUT (they drop to the member rate) — same contract as the editor.
  * Idempotent: an already-active member gets no second grant, but is still repriced.
