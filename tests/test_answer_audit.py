"""The answer audit must catch the bugs that actually shipped.

A checker that never fires is worse than none — it manufactures confidence.
These fixtures are the real answers production gave on 2026-07-20, so if the
audit logic drifts, the cases it was built for go red.

Offline: audit() takes an answer string, so nothing here touches the network.
