"""Per-layer grouping of AI-created stresses in Biofield Intake.

`list_stresses` returns a `by_layer` view: for each causal-chain layer, every
stress whose code is covered by that layer's remedy PLUS the layer's own head
stress. A stress covered by several layers' remedies appears under EACH (chosen
behavior). Stresses on no layer fall into `unassigned`. `render_stress_panel`
renders that grouping.
